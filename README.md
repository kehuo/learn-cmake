## Tutorial

### Step 1 - A Basic Starting Point 

Where do I start with CMake? This step will provide an introduction to some of CMake's basic syntax, commands, and variables. As these concepts are introduced, we will work through three exercises and create a simple CMake project.

Each exercise in this step will start with some background information. Then, a goal and list of helpful resources are provided. Each file in the Files to Edit section is in the Step1 directory and contains one or more TODO comments. Each TODO represents a line or two of code to change or add. The TODO s are intended to be completed in numerical order, first complete TODO 1 then TODO 2, etc. The Getting Started section will give some helpful hints and guide you through the exercise. Then the Build and Run section will walk step-by-step through how to build and test the exercise. Finally, at the end of each exercise the intended solution is discussed.

Also note that each step in the tutorial builds on the next. So, for example, the starting code for Step2 is the complete solution to Step1.
